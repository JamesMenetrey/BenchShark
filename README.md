# BenchShark #

A lightweight library for benchmarking performance of your .NET applications. BenchShark provides a powerful and easy to use API to evaluate the speed of your functions in order to track down the bottlenecks within your code.

At the opposite of most software that profile the entire of .NET applications generically, this library is made to target predefined functions to evaluate, the results are then queryable programmatically.

BenchShark was written in accordance with the best practices exposed by [Eric Lippert](http://ericlippert.com/about-eric-lippert/) in his articles called « C# Performance Benchmark Mistakes » [Part One](http://tech.pro/blog/1293/c-performance-benchmark-mistakes-part-one), [Part Two](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1295/c-performance-benchmark-mistakes-part-two), [Part Three](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1317/c-performance-benchmark-mistakes-part-three) and [Part Four](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1433/performance-benchmark-mistakes-part-four).
